### 1. Introduction
<br>

This (Troubleshooting) section is provided to help developers with ideas and suggestions how to resolve problems related to using Aurelia KendoUI bridge. The content of this section will grow with time as the Aurelia-UI-Toolkits team plans to share the real life problems and solutions encountered so far.

The **[next page](#/help/docs/troubleshooting/2._using_gists_and_gistrun)** in this section is describing the use of the newly added support for **[GistRun](https://gist.run/)** tool, which we expect to dramatically reduce the time needed to solve most user problems.

If you are Aurelia-XXX bridge developer or considering to get involved in that family of projects, the page **[Creating gists for KendoUI bridge catalog application](#/help/docs/notes_on_the_bridge/10._creating_gists_for_catalog_app)** provides more information in how to create gists specific to the bridge's catalog application.
